        <h1>Habit Stacking: The Why, What, & How to Make Skin Care Stick</h1>
        <p>Hellooooo January. It’s that time of year again when we all make and break habits over bubbling champagne and a resolute attitude. Resolutions are made, with the promise of a healthier, happier 2024. Here at Ohlolly, we believe skin care is a wonderful, yet oft overlooked, gateway to a healthier lifestyle. Sure, skin care is a great way to look lovely, but beyond that, it’s also a vital part of your body’s health. So how do we implement, or improve, skin care as a healthy habit?</p>

        <h1>First, understanding the WHY</h1>
        <p>Why is skin care important? The skin is the largest organ of the body. It braces the elements to protect us from debris, bacteria, sun damage, and more. So why does it feel so indulgent to care for it properly? Skin care is part of the body’s overall health – and healthy skin can be an indication of a holistically healthy body. Looking radiant is just an added bonus (yes, we’re called Ohlolly Beauty – because beauty comes FROM healthy, happy skin!).</p>

        <h1>Finally, the HOW</h1>
        <p>Skin care is not just an indulgent hobby, and it certainly isn’t just a New Year’s Resolution. This year, reboot your skin care regime, so that no matter your age, skin concerns, or previous habits, this year can be your healthiest, glowiest skin yet. And remember, skin care is meant to be tailored for YOU. Even small healthy habits can hugely impact your skin.</p>
